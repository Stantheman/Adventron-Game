TODO

The major idea to keep above all todo items is that Adventron is a PORT.
I need to focus on finishing the game as it was before thinking of the 
cool things I could change to make it fun. Before going hog-wild and 
being sad about the enjoyment, I need to finish what I started. That said, 
here are the things I can change in Adventron 1.0:

Adventron 1.0:
 * - Update map files to include monster's starting position.
 * - Directional static variables into the map class. SPEED problem!!
     When an entity is looking up, it's looking up based on the MAP. 
     Can't move it because it depends on an entity's speed. alternative?
 * - Monsters move normal. They should also shoot in different directions 
     and intelligently. A*? Pacman AI inspiration. This can be optional, 
     considering the original code.
 * - Monsters accidentally kill other monsters and the player gets score points. 
     Add an owner flag in the bullet class.
 * - The detection algorithm assumes the new location will be in the same quadrant
     Either check that location's quadrant or hardcode the maps correctly.
 * - Add the boss levels. I don't remember how the player transported, and I 
     /do/ remember the boss levels being the result of a lot of hackery.
 * - Make a level debug mode to fix the levels easier.
 
 Adventron 2.0
 * - Recode everything to be stateful and more object-oriented. I used 
     to be conservative making new files, but it makes more sense logically.
 * - More weapons!
 * - Monster-generating squares specified in the level file.
 * - More levels!
 * - Slick2D or another opengl-based graphics library?
 * - Look for a better input method?
