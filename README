Adventron (the game)
====================

I originally wrote my first graphical game when I was much younger and 
called it "Adventron." It used the Windows command window and Windows API
to move ASCII characters around and accept input from a top-down 2D perspective.
It was written in a mix of beginner's C/C++ and doesn't compile on today's 
compilers (thank you for the good times, Borland.)

This port is in Java and is also my getting used to Git and some of the
more interesting pieces of Java. I've never ported anything either, so 
it's that too!
